Question 1:


When users choose “Cancel” method returns JOptionPane.CANCEL_OPTION; however the current program only checks if users choose “Yes”, and treats everything else as “No”, including “Cancel”. That means if the user clicks “Cancel”, the message will still say: "You've chosen: No".



Question 2:

To customize the options in a JOptionPane, one thing you can do is to use the showOptionDialog method instead of showConfirmDialog. This method gives you full control over the buttons displayed in the dialog box. One example:
 
Object[] options = {"I do", "I don't"}; 
int option = JOptionPane.showOptionDialog(null,
	"Do you want to change to the first class ticket?",
	"Ticket Change",
	JOptionPane.YES_NO_OPTION,
	JOptionPane.QUESTION_MESSAGE,
	null,
	options,
	options[0]);
