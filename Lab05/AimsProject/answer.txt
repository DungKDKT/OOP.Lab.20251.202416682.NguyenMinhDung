Q1: Why do the titles remain the same after swap(jungleDVD, cinderellaDVD)?

Answer: Because Java passes references by value
The swap() method receives copies of the references jungleDVD and cinderellaDVD
Inside swap(), when we do o1 = o2 and o2 = tmp, we're only swapping these local copies
The original references in main() remain pointing to the same objects

Q2: Why is JungleDVD's title changed after changeTitle(jungleDVD, cinderellaDVD.getTitle())?

Answer:Because the reference allows us to access and modify the object's internal state
changeTitle() receives a copy of the reference to the Jungle DVD object
Even though it's a copy, it still points to the same object in memory
When we call dvd.setTitle(title), we're modifying the actual object's title field
Then the method creates a new object and assigns it to the local parameter dvd, but this doesn't affect jungleDVD in main()
